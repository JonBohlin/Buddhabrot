The difference between a Buddhabrot and a Mandelbrot fractal is that the Buddhabrot is based on diverging polynomials and not the converging ones as is the case for Mandelbrot fractals. Please allow for 20 seconds to a couple of minutes for it to finish. Adjusting the number of threads will result in different variations of the Buddhabrot - not all equally nice looking.

The easiest way to compile and run is to create a new .NET 5.0 project in Visual Studio and include the source code.
